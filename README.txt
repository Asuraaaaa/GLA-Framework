To install the GLA Framework properly, import SQL.sql.
It should make it's own database.
Then copy the data folder (yes, the entire folder, not just the contents) to the root of the server's C: drive.
Then fill in all of the credentials, IP, and other info in the config.cfg.
You will need the latest server artifacts from https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/
You will also need to get mysql-async from another source.
Note that essentialmode 5.0.3 and newer have been known to cause issues with this framework, I don't recommend using it.
Also note that this framework was made with a server running Windows Server 2016. If your setup is different, your mileage may vary. Just sayin.
